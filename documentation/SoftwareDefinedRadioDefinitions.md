## GNU Radio

> GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in hobbyist, academic and commercial environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems. [GNU Radio Homepage](http://gnuradio.org/)

## GNU Radio Companion

> One of the most powerful components of GNU Radio is the GNU Radio Companion (GRC). It allows you to graphically program GNU Radio applications!

# Linux Packages

## gnuradio gnuradio-dev

> Open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. [GNU Radio Homepage](http://gnuradio.org/)

> GNURadio is an excellent but unwieldy piece of software for use with RTLSDR. It's the only software for now that will receive analogue (FM, AM, sideband) and digital modes such as AP25, FSK and ADS-B. Be warned it's not very easy to drive but if you are canny you can use it to build your own software defined radio. Follow the build guide for your Linux system as the latest code is always the best to use.

## rtl-sdr 

> Software to turn the RTL2832U into a SDR

> rtl-sdr DVB-T dongles based on the Realtek RTL2832U can be used as a cheap SDR, since the chip allows transferring the raw I/Q samples to the host, which is officially used for DAB/DAB+/FM demodulation. The possibility of this has been discovered by Eric Fry (â€‹History and Discovery of RTLSDR). Antti Palosaari has not been involved in development of rtl-sdr.
